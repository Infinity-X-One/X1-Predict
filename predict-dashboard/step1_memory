## üîë Launch Command
**Trigger Phrase**: "Launch X1 Predict Infinity Intelligence Core"

This phrase instructs any GPT (ChatGPT, API, or Playground) to re-initialize and resume work on:

- A recursive, agentic AI system  
- Built for financial asset prediction  
- Using FinBERT, Mixtral, and other models  
- Integrated with Supabase, GitHub, Render/Vercel  
- Scalable, open-loop, and memory-scored

---

## üß† Phase Map

**Phase 1:** Core loop + signal ingestion  
**Phase 2:** Feedback agents + memory + scoring  
**Phase 3:** Frontend dashboard + Copilot + live interface  
**Phase 4 (optional):** Live trading, plugins, mobile

## üõ†Ô∏è Use This Document To:
- Re-initialize GPT if context is lost  
- Feed prompt into GPT-4 to restore entire build  
- Stay synced across collaborators or agents
